Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

# Using MinMax Algorithm to Solve tic-tac-toe Game
Minimax is a recursive algorithm which is used to choose an optimal move for a player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally. As its name suggests, its goal is to minimize the maximum loss (minimize the worst case scenario).
The algorithm searches recursively, the best move that leads the *Max* player to win or not lose (draw). It consider the current state of the game and the available moves at that state, then for each valid move it plays (alternating *min* and *max*) until it finds a terminal state (win, draw or lose).
